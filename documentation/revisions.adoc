# Revisions

## Version 0.1.0

Initial version.

## Version 1.0.0

 * Removed POD storage mark policy, which relied on `reinterpret_cast`s as it would not guarantee
   the expected results according to C++ rules. We now only have "dual" storage mark policy which
   relies on _common initial sequence_ guarantee in unions.

 * For dual policy, no need to derive it from a special tag. Instead, a fourth type was added to
   the policy: `representation_type`. Typically, `representation_type` is same as `storage_type`,
   but when using dual storage the two may be different. The former is the type for which you define
   the mark value, while the latter is the type used for storage. See documentation for more details.

 * Removed the tag parameter to `markable` as it was observed that the same effect can be achieved
   by inheriting from a mark policy rather than using it directly. See the documentation for details.

## Version 1.0.1

 * Made value constructors explicit: we never wanted to convert from `T` to `markable<T>`.

## Version 1.0.2

 * Added concepts support. Enabled when macro `AK_TOOLKIT_WITH_CONCEPTS` is defined prior to the inclusion of the header file.
 * Added assignment functions for value and storage value.

## Version 2.0.0

 * Provided equality comparisons as policy.
 * Added `default_markable<T>` for selecting a default marked-value policy for a given `T`.
