## Overview

This library offers a way to represent optional (or nullable) objects (objects that may not have a value) of type `T`
by encoding the no-value state in one of the states of `T`.
This is an alternative to link:http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html[`boost::optional`]
that offers a limited interface and a guarantee that the size of optional `T` is the same as the size of `T`.

In order to create an optional object type for your type `T`,
you first need to decide how you want to represent the the no-value state in `T`.
Suppose you want to use type `int` and want `-1` to represent the no-value.
Now you have to define an _marked value policy_: a type that formally reflects how the no-value is represented.
Luckily, for this common case the library comes with a predefined class template that you can use:
`mark_int<int, -1>`. With this policy, you can define the type of the optional object, and use it:

```c++
markable<mark_int<int, -1>> oi; // optional int
static_assert(sizeof(oi) == sizeof(int), "no size penalty");
```

Instances of `markable` have a very small interface. They are copyable and movable.
The default constructor initializes an object with the value indicated by the marked-value policy.
Another explicit constructor takes the value of `T`:

```c++
using opt_int = markable<mark_int<int, -1>>;
opt_int oi;      // internal value initialized to -1 (as per policy)
opt_int o1 {0};  // internal value initialized to 0
opt_int oN {-1}; // internal value initialized to -1
```

There are also three observer functions:

 * `has_value` that checks if the currently stored value is that indicated in the _marked-value policy_ (MP);
 * `value` that extracts the stored value, with the precondition that the value is different than the one indicated in (MP);
 * `storage_value` that extracts the value as stored internally, with no precondition.

```c++
// continuing the previous example
assert (!oi.has_value());
assert ( o0.has_value());
assert (!oN.has_value());

assert (o0.value() == 0);
// oi.value() is UB
// oN.value() is UB

assert (oi.storage_value() == -1);
assert (o0.storage_value() ==  0);
assert (oN.storage_value() == -1);
```

As you can see, there are two ways to set the special marked value: either by default construction,
or by providing it explicitly.

It is not possible to change the stored value through function `value()`: it returns a non-mutable reference or value (based on the policy).

There are no relational operations provided by default, as it is not obvious how a no-value should compare against other values.
If you want to compare them, you need to provide a custom comparator, where you explicitly state how the marked state is treated, or you can select comparison policy in the second template parameter.

There is no way to 'reset' the optional object other than to move-assign a new value:

```c++
// continuing the previous example
o0 = {};         // reset to marked value
oN = opt_int{2}; // new value
```

Each instance of `markable` also provides three nested types:

 * `value_type` - value we want to represent,
 * `reference_type` - what function `value` returns: in most cases it is `const value_type&`,
 * `storage_type` - type of the value that is used for storage: in most of the cases it is same as `value_type`.


### Storage value

Objects of type `markable<MP>` actually store an object of type `MP::storage_type`.
Sometimes this type is same as `MP::value_type` but it is not the rule. For instance,
when representing optional enum class `E` with underlying type `int`, `MP::value_type`
is `E` whereas `MP::storage_type` is `int`:

```c++
enum class E { V0, V1 };

using OptE = markable<mark_enum<E, -1>>;
static_assert(std::is_same_v<OptE::value_type, E>);
static_assert(std::is_same_v<OptE::storage_type, int>);
```

`markable<MP>` always stores a value of type `MP::storage_type`:

```c++
OptE o;
assert(o.storage_value() == -1);

o.assign_storage(1);
assert(o.storage_value() == 1);
```

In addition to that, the storage can represent an empty or a non-empty optional
value:

```c++
OptE o;
assert(!o.has_value());

o.assign_storage(1);
assert(o.has_value());
assert(o.value() == E::V1);
```

Thus, `markable<MP>` provides two interfaces: one for modifying and observing the
`MP::value_type`, and the other for modifying and observing the `MP::storage_type`.


## Marked-value policies

What type is being stored and how the marked value is encoded is controlled by _marked-value policy_. You can either define your own, or use one of the policies provided with this library:

### mark_int

```c++
template <typename Integral, Integral EV> struct mark_int;
```

Can be used with all types that can be used as template non-type parameters, including built-in integral arithmetic types and pointers.

`Integral` represents the stored type.

`EV` is the marked value representation.

### mark_fp_nan

```c++
template <typename FPT> struct mark_fp_nan;
```

A policy for floating-point types, where the marked value is encoded as quiet NaN.

`FPT` needs to be a floating-point scalar type.

### mark_value_init

```c++
template <typename T> struct mark_value_init;
```

A policy for storing any `Regular` type, the marked value is represented by a value-initialized `T`.

`T` must meet the requirements of `Regular`: be default constructible, copyable, moveable, and `EqualityComparable`.

### mark_stl_empty

```c++
template <typename Cont> struct mark_stl_empty;
```

Marked value is created using value initialization. Marked value is checked by calling member function `empty()`.
Useful for STL containers where we want the empty container to represent the no-value.

`T` must be default constructible and have a member function `empty()`.


### mark_bool

```c++
struct mark_bool;
```

This is the policy for storing an optional `bool` in a compact way, such that the size of `markable<mark_bool>` is 1.

### mark_enum
```c++
template <typename Enum, std::underlying_type_t<Enum> Val> struct mark_enum;
```

A policy for storing any enum, the marked value is represented by the indicated integral value `Val`,
which can be outside the range of valid enum values.

`Enum` must be an enumeration type.

### mark_optional

```c++
template <typename Optional> struct mark_optional;
```

This policy is used for types that cannot (or do not want to) spare any value to indicate the marked state.
We logically represent optional `T`, but store it in `boost::optional<T>` or `std::experimental::optional<T>`.

`Optional` must be an instance of either `boost::optional` or `std::experimental::optional`.

### Defining a custom marked-value policy

In order to provide a custom marked-value policy to store a given type `T`,
we need to provide a class that derive it from `markable_type<T>` and implements two static member functions:
`marked_value` and `is_marked_value`:

```c++
struct mark_string_with_0s : markable_type<std::string>
{
  static representation_type marked_value() {
    return std::string("\0\0", 2);
  }
  static bool is_marked_value(const representation_type& v) {
    return v.compare(0, v.npos, "\0\0", 2) == 0;
  }
};
```

Base class `markable_type<T>` defines all the necessary nested types and some house-keeping functions.
With it, we are declaring what type we will be storing.

Function `marked_value` returns a value of the "representation" type (`representation_type`) that represents the marked value.

Function `is_marked_value` returns true iff the the given value is recognized as the marked value.

In a less likely case where we want to store the represent an optional value of type `T`,
but store it internally in a different type, we need to provide more arguments to `markable_type<T>`.
Suppose we want to implement the policy for storing type `bool` in a storage of size 1 (the same way that `mark_bool` does).
We need three states: no-value, `true`, and `false`. We cannot store it in type `bool` because it only has two states.
So, for storage we will use type `char`. We will use value `2` (`'\2'`) to represent the marked state,
value `0` to represent value `false` and `1` to represent `true`. Now, apart from defining how the marked state is encodes,
we also need to provide a recipe on how to encode a `bool` in a `char`, and how to extract the `bool` value from `char` storage.
We need to define additional two static member functions: `access_value` and `store_value`:

```c++
struct compact_bool_policy : markable_type<bool, char, bool> // see below
{
  static representation_type marked_value() { return char(2); }
  static bool is_marked_value(representation_type v) { return v == 2; }

  static reference_type access_value(const storage_type& v) { return bool(v); }
  static storage_type store_value(const value_type& v) { return v; }
};
```

The three types passed to `markable_type` denote respectively:

1. `value_type` -- the type we are modelling.
2. `storage_type` -- the type we use to store the values internally.
3. `reference_type` -- what type function `value` should return.

Class template `markable_type` also provides the fourth type: `representation_type`,
which in this case defaults to `storage_type`. Because function `value()` should return a `bool`
and we are storing no `bool` we have to create a temporary value,
and return it by value: therefore type `reference_type` is not really a reference.


### Default marked-value policies

There is also a possibility to select a default mark-value policy for a given type.

```c++
default_markable<int> iN, i0(0);_
```

Alias `default_markable` selects the marked policy and uses it in `markable`
template. This mechanism tries to pick the best policy:

* `mark_int<T, std::numeric_limits<T>::max()>` for built-in integral types,
* `mark_fp_nan<T>` for floating-point types,
* `mark_bool` for `bool`,
* `mark_enum<T, std::numeric_limits<typename std::underlying_type<T>::type>::max()` for enumerations,
* `mark_value_init<T>` otherwise.

It is possible that the default policy selection will create an ill-formed type.
Also, note that the policy selected by default may not work for your use case.
Manual policy selection might be preferred, because you are in control of
what is actually selected.


### Using dual storage for marking values

Sometimes there is no spare value of `T`, but there is a spare combination of member values in `DUAL<T>`,
where `DUAL<T>` a type layout-compatible with `T` but without invariants.  Consider the following type
representing a range of integers:

```c++
class range
{
  int min_, max_;
  bool invariant() const { return min_ <= max_; }

public:
  range(int min, int max) : min_(min), max_(max) { assert (invariant()); }
  int min() const { assert (invariant()); return min_; }
  int max() const { assert (invariant()); return max_; }
  ~range() { assert (invariant()); }
};
```

It is guaranteed and enforced with assertions that `min_` is never greater than `max_`.
This leaves many spare combinations of values, e.g., `{0, -1}`. But if we try to use them,
we violate the invariant, and trigger assertion failure. To address such cases,
`markable` provides the dual storage. This will only work if your type is standard-layout.
You need to define a type layout-compatible with `range`:

```c++
struct range_representation
{
  int min_, max_;
};
```

Now you can request a "dual storage". It is a union that holds either a real type or its weaker counterpart:

```c++
union
{
  range                value_;
  range_representation representation_;
};
```

Now, either we are storing a value (first member is active),
or we are storing the row type (second member is active),
in which we can encode the value impossible in value type.
We do not know which member of the union is active at a given moment,
but it is always safe to inspect the value of member `representation_`.
This is guaranteed by the _common initial sequence_ feature of unions in C++.
When we observe the special value, we know that the second member is active.
Otherwise we know that the active member is `value_`.

In order to define the mark policy, you have to inherit from `markable_dual_storage_type` and define the special value:

```c++
struct mark_range : markable_dual_storage_type<mark_range, range, range_representation>
{
  static representation_type marked_value() noexcept { return {0, -1}; }
  static bool is_marked_value(const representation_type& v) noexcept { return v.min_ > v.max_; }
};
```

The first argument is the type of the policy we are defining. (We are using the CRTP.)
The second is the logical value type, and the third is itd "raw" layout-compatible conterpart.

WARNING: However, there is a certain danger involved when using dual storage. Types `T` and `DualT` passed to `markable_dual_storage_type` need to preserve certain relation: they have to be layout-compatible. There is no way to enforce it statically in C++, so you have to make sure this is the case. Otherwise you are risking UB.

To guarantee that two Standard Layout types are layout-compatible is difficult, especially if at some point you have to add a member datat to `T`. It requires that the members of two types decompose to similar basic types with the same layout. In order to minimize the risk of the types becoming non layout compatible, we recommend te following technique. Define the `struct` only for storing members. Than have both `T` and its representation counterpart inferit from te member-storing struct. The inheriting types should not define any members:

```c++
struct range_members
{
  int min_, max_;
};

class range : private range_members
{
  bool invariant() const { return min_ <= max_; }

public:
  range(int min, int max) : range_members{min, max} { assert (invariant()); }
  int min() const { assert (invariant()); return min_; }
  int max() const { assert (invariant()); return max_; }
  ~range() { assert (invariant()); }
};

struct range_representation : range_members
{
  range_representation() noexcept : range_members{0, -1} {};
};
```

This way there is only one place that defines members for both types.

Using `markable_dual_storage_type` requires that the dual storage has a `noexcept` move constructor and that the marked-value policy function `marked_value()` is also `noexcept`. This requirement is necessary to guarantee exceptions safety for `markable` object. If this requirement is not met the attempt to instantiate a markable object will result in a compile-time error.

If either of the functions is not `noexcept` in your case but you still want to use the policy and take the risk that neither of the two functions will ever throw, you can use class template `markable_dual_storage_type_unsafe` instead. This type does not enforce `noexcept` statically, but will call `std::terminate` should any of the two functions throw when performing operations on `markable` in critical places.


## Relational operators

By default `markable` objects are not equally comparable. In order to make them comparable, you have to first decide how you want the mark values (there can be more than one mark value) to compare relative to other values. If you want any marked value to compare equal to any other marked value and compare unequal to any non-marked value, use comparison policy `cmp_by_value_eq`:

```c++
struct mark_negative : markable_type<int>
{
  static bool is_marked_value(const int& v) { return v < 0; } // any negative value is marked
  static int marked_value() { return -1; }
};

using opt_nonnegative_int = markable<mark_negative, cmp_by_value_eq>;
assert (opt_nonnegative_int{} == opt_nonnegative_int{-2});
```

If you want to compare `markable` objects by simply comparing their storage values (which is likely faster, but different marked values compare unequal), use comparoison policy `cmp_by_storage`:

```c++
using opt_nonnegative_int = markable<mark_negative, cmp_by_storage>;
assert (opt_nonnegative_int{} != opt_nonnegative_int{-2});
```

If you do not want your `markable` types to be comparable, do not provide the second parameter, or use comparison policy `cmp_none`.


## Opaque-typedefed markables

Because `markable` uses policies, you can get the opaque typedef for your markable types for free.

Suppose you have two conceptually different types `Count` and `Num`, but because they are markable types using the same policy, they end um being one and the same type:

```c++
using Count = markable<mark_int<int, -1>>;
using Num   = markable<mark_int<int, -1>>;

static_assert(std::is_same<Count, Num>::value, "same type");
```

In orer to make the two markable types distinct, you can alter the type of the policies (but not their semantics) by inheriting from them:

```c++
struct mark_count : mark_int<int, -1> {};
struct mark_num   : mark_int<int, -1> {};

using Count = markable<mark_count>;
using Num   = markable<mark_num>;

static_assert(!std::is_same<Count, Num>::value, "different types!");
```


## Comparison with Boost.Optional

This library is not a replacement for link:http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html[`boost::optional`]. While there is some overlap, both libraries target different use cases.

### Genericity

`boost::optional` is really generic: It will work practically with any `T`,
to the extent that you can use `optional<optional<T>>`. You just give the type `T` and you get the optional object wrapper.
In contrast, in `markable` from the outset you have to make a choice case-by-case how you want to store the 'marked' value `T`.
The policy for managing the marked state is part of the contract, part of semantics, part of the type.
Having a nested `markable` is technically possible, but requires sparing two values of `T`.

Some type `T` may not have a 'spare' value to indicate the marked state. In such case, `markable` cannot help you.
In contrast, `boost::optional<T>` will work just fine: the additional marked state is stored separately.
In a way, `boost::optional<T>` can be thought as link:http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/variant.html[`boost::variant`]`<boost::none_t, T>`.

### Life-time management

`boost::optional<T>` gives you a useful guarantee that if you initialize it to a no-value state, no object of type `T` is created. This is useful for run-time performance reasons and allows a two phase initialization. In contrast, `markable` upon construction, immediately constructs a `T`. `markable` simply contains `T` as subobject. In contrast, `boost::optional` only provides a storage for `T` and creates and destroys the contained object as needed.

### No container-like semantics

`boost::optional<T>` is almost a container, capable of storing 0 or 1 elements. When it stores one element, you can alter its value. It is impossible in `markable`: its value and the "container's size" are one thing. But in exchange, the latter, because it only provides a non-mutable access to the contained value, it can build the return value on the fly, similarly to the proxy reference in `std::vector<bool>`, but because we only provide a non-mutable reference, it is much simpler and safer. This is why we can provide a markable for type `bool` (which has no spare value) with the `sizeof` of a single `char`.

### Expressiveness vs non-ambiguity

`markable` has a minimalistic interface: this is also to avoid any surprises. As a cost it is less expressive and convenient. There are no implicit conversions, no overloaded operators; unlike `boost::optional`, it does not have `operator==` by default: you have to specify a comparison policy and decide yourself how you want to compare the no-value states.


## Intended use

In general, it is expected that in the first pass of the implementation of your program, you will use `boost::optional<T>` as a simple ready-to-use solution. Later, if you determine that `boost::optional` kills your performance, you can think of replacing it with `markable` and how you want to represent the no-value state.

Another use case is when you are currently using objects of scalar types with encoded special values (like type `std::string::size_type` with value `std::string::npos`) and you want to change it into something safer but be sure you are adding no runtime overhead. You can change your type to `markable<mark_int<string::size_type, string::npos>>`.

## Future plans

Provide relational operations upon request.
